# Image Recognition Experiment
This codebase stores the resources and custom JavaScript code to run a cognition experiment where participants are primed with sentences containing intact/sliced food before they are shown a various food objects. We record the response time and vary sentence/picture combinations across conditions to test how people pre-visualize object state changes.   

We use the JavaScript package jsPsych, a custom package for creating browser experiments.
